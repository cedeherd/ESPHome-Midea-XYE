# ESPHome-Midea-XYE

ESPHome external component for controlling Midea HVAC systems over the XYE/CCM RS-485 bus. Provides a native Home Assistant climate entity with full mode, fan, and setpoint support.

## Overview

This component communicates with Midea-like air conditioners (heat pumps) via the XYE protocol over RS-485.

For detailed protocol documentation, see [PROTOCOL.md](esphome/components/midea_xye/PROTOCOL.md).

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 or ESP32 board (e.g., D1 Mini)
- RS-485 to TTL converter dongle
- Connection to your Midea HVAC unit's XYE/CCM RS-485 bus

## Installation

Add this external component to your ESPHome configuration:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: 
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/HomeOps/ESPHome-Midea-XYE
      ref: main
    components: [midea_xye]
```

## Configuration

### Basic Example

```yaml
esphome:
  name: heatpump
  friendly_name: Heatpump

esp8266:  # also works with esp32
  board: d1_mini

# Enable logging (but not via UART)
logger:
  baud_rate: 0
  # Optional: Enable debug logging for XYE protocol messages
  # logs:
  #   midea_xye: DEBUG

external_components:
  - source: 
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/HomeOps/ESPHome-Midea-XYE
      ref: main
    components: [midea_xye]

# UART settings for RS-485 converter dongle (required)
uart:
  tx_pin: TX
  rx_pin: RX
  baud_rate: 4800
  debug:  # If you want to help reverse engineer
    direction: BOTH

# Main settings
climate:
  - platform: midea_xye
    name: Heatpump
    period: 1s                  # Optional. Defaults to 1s
    timeout: 100ms              # Optional. Defaults to 100ms
    use_fahrenheit: false       # Optional. Defaults to false
```

### Follow-Me Example

The Follow-Me feature allows the AC unit to use a remote temperature sensor (like one in your living room) instead of its built-in sensor. This provides better temperature control for the entire room.

```yaml
# Temperature sensor (example using Home Assistant)
sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: living_room_temp
    entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature

climate:
  - platform: midea_xye
    name: Heatpump
    follow_me_sensor: living_room_temp  # AC uses this sensor for temperature readings
```

The component will automatically:
- Send temperature updates when the sensor value changes
- Send periodic updates every 30 seconds to keep the AC informed
- No lambda or automation needed!

## Debugging

### Enabling Protocol Debug Logging

To see detailed XYE protocol messages (useful for troubleshooting or protocol reverse engineering), enable debug logging for the component:

```yaml
logger:
  baud_rate: 0  # Required: Disable UART logging to avoid conflicts with RS-485
  logs:
    midea_xye: DEBUG  # Enable debug-level logging for XYE protocol
```

With debug logging enabled, you'll see:
- **TX Messages**: Outgoing messages sent to the HVAC unit (operation mode, fan mode, target temperature, etc.)
- **RX Messages**: Incoming messages from the HVAC unit (current state, temperatures, flags, etc.)
- All field values are shown in hex format (e.g., `0x50 (20.0°C)`)
- Enum values show both name and hex (e.g., `0x88 (COOL)` or `0x99 (UNKNOWN)`)
- Bounds checking prevents displaying garbage data from truncated messages

Example debug output:
```
[D][midea_xye:186] TX Message:
[D][midea_xye:186]   Frame Header:
[D][midea_xye:186]     command: 0xC0 (QUERY)
[D][midea_xye:186]   TransmitMessageData:
[D][midea_xye:186]     operation_mode: 0x88 (COOL)
[D][midea_xye:186]     fan_mode: 0x80 (FAN_AUTO)
[D][midea_xye:186]     target_temperature: 0x50 (20.0°C)
```

## Features

### What Works
- Setting mode (off, auto, fan, cool, heat, dry)
- Setting temperature (can send in Celsius or Fahrenheit; handles AC results in both; must manually set in YAML)
- Setting fan mode (auto, low, medium, high)
- Reading inside and outside air temperatures
- Reading inside coil temperature and outside coil temperature
- Reading timer start/stop times (set by remote)
- Follow-Me temperature - automatically sends room temperature from a configured sensor to the AC unit. Updates on sensor state changes and every 30 seconds.

### Known Issues
- Current reading always shows 255
- Setting swing mode not working

### Not Yet Implemented
- Setting timers directly to unit (not a high priority since automations can handle this)
- Forcing display to show Celsius or Fahrenheit (setting temp in Celsius doesn't force display to Celsius)
- Freeze protection
- Silent mode
- Lock/Unlock

### Not Tested
- IR integration (however, not needed for Follow-Me functionality)

## Smart Thermostat

Smart thermostat features (preset-based temperature management, inside/outside sensor logic, Home/Sleep/Away modes) are implemented as a Home Assistant-level virtual climate device:
